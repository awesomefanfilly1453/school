        <p class="text-muted text-left">Smartclass is a digital initiative, which is rapidly transforming the way teachers teach and students learn in schools with innovative and meaningful use of technology. Powered by the world’s largest repository of digital content mapped to Indian School Curriculum, smartclass brings in technology right next to the blackboard for teachers in the classrooms. Students learn difficult and abstract curriculum concepts watching highly engaging visuals and animations. This makes learning an enjoyable experience for students while improving their overall academic performance in school.

The school has tied up with Educomp for setting up Smartclass in the school classrooms. With the introduction of EDUCOMP SMART CLASS teaching has been made more interesting for the students.</p>
